# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon rendering issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  The problem involves unexpected visual glitches or misalignment of elements, especially in more complex layouts or when applying multiple Tailwind directives.  The likely cause is a conflict between Tailwind classes or an improper application of Tailwind directives. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check for Conflicting Classes:** Carefully review the Tailwind classes used.  Overlapping or conflicting directives can lead to unexpected results.
2. **Verify Class Order:** The order in which classes are applied can sometimes influence the output. Experiment with different class orders.
3. **Inspect Browser DevTools:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS. This can help identify the root cause of the issue.
4. **Simplify the Layout:** Temporarily simplify your layout to isolate the problematic area and narrow down the source of the conflict.
5. **Purge Unused Styles:** Ensure you are purging unused Tailwind classes to minimize CSS bloat and potential conflicts.
